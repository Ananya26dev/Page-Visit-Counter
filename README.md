# Visitor Counter

The Page Visit Counter project is a React.js app that tracks and displays the number of times a page has been visited. It uses localStorage to store the visit count, incrementing the count each time the user revisits the page. The app leverages React's useEffect and useState hooks to update and display the visit count in a responsive and user-friendly design with React-Bootstrap components.
